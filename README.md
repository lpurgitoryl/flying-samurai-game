My intro to HTML5 games!
I've always been an avid gamer. Flash (before it reached it's end of life) based games like coolmathgames and armorgames in computer lab time was something I always looked forward too as a kid. I thought it was time to dabble in game devlopement but I felt like jumping into Unity would be a big leap and that's where HTML5 comes to rescue! I think this is perfect meduim to learn game dev concepts and get up and running quickly.
