# FLYING SAMURAI

A two player acrade style game.
Fight... TILL THE DEATH or until time runs out.
Made using vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript.

## Background

My intro to HTML5 games!
I've always been an avid gamer. Flash (before it reached it's end of life) based games like [coolmathgames](https://www.coolmathgames.com/) and [armorgames](https://armorgames.com/) in computer lab time was something I always looked forward too as a kid. I thought it was time to dabble in game devlopement but I felt like jumping into Unity would be a big leap and that's where HTML5 comes to rescue! I think this is perfect meduim to learn game dev concepts, brush up on my vanilla html/css/javascript skills and be able to get up and running quickly.
